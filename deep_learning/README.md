# Text-Classification-Pytorch
## Description
This repository contains the implmentation of various text classification models like RNN, LSTM, Attention, CNN, etc in PyTorch deep learning framework along with a detailed documentation of each of the model.

Text Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Natural Language Processing. In this repository, I am focussing on one such text classification task and that is Sentiment Analysis. So far I have covered following six different models in this repo.

  * RNN
  * LSTM
  * LSTM + Attention
  * Self Attention
  * CNN
  * RCNN

## Requirements
  * Python==3.6.6
  * PyTorch==0.4.0
  * torchtext==0.2.3

## Downloads and Setup
Once you clone this repo, run the main.py file to process the dataset and to train the model.
```shell
$ python main.py
```
